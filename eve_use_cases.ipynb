Embeddings allow search system to find relevant documents not just based on keyword matches, but on semantic understanding.\n",

They learn to encode the semantic meaning of words, sentences, and documents in a way that captures relationships between them.

Among aviation emissions, condensation trails (contrails) formed from water vapor emissions behind aircraft engines has gained greater attention during recent years. Contrails are formed under certain thermodynamic constraints (Schmidt, 1941; Appleman, 1953; Schumann, 2005) and can evolve into cirrus clouds under favorable conditions (Minnis et al., 2004). Both contrails and contrail-induced cirrus clouds could play important roles in the global climate change via affecting the radiation budget. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identified contrails as the most uncertain components of the aviation impacts on climate with a low level of scientific understanding (Sausen et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2009). Clearly, knowledge of how contrail ice particles are formed from aircraft emissions and how they evolve into contrails and cirrus clouds is critical to understanding climate impacts of contrails and contrail-induced cirrus clouds.',\n",
       " 'Many field measurements, such as Subsonic Aircraft: Contrail and Cloud Effects Special Study (SUCCESS) (Toon and Miake-Lye, 1998), Pollution from Aircraft Emissions in the North Atlantic Flight Corridor (POLINAT) (Schumann, 2000), and SULFUR series (Schumann et al., 2002), were carried out to elucidate important parameters affecting contrail ice particle formation and contrail evolution. Modeling studies were also performed to understand contrail formation mechanisms and potential impacts of contrails to global climate change (Brown et al., 1996; Karcher, 1998a; Yu and Turco, 1998; Karcher et al., 2007). The initial properties of ice crystals in near-field aircraft plumes are of particular interest, since these properties are critical in the representation of emitted aerosols and contrails in large scale modelssuch as global climate models or large eddy simulations (Shrigaonkar and Lele, 2006). This information can only be obtained via modeling due to instrumental limitations in near-field aircraft plumes within five wingspans downstream (\\\\(\\\\sim\\\\)1 s) of an aircraft engine.\\n\\nDespite many efforts spent in modeling the microphysics of ice crystal formation in jet regime (with a plume age \\\\(<\\\\)5 s), systematic understanding of the roles of chemi-ions, ambient conditions, fuel sulfur contents, and soot emissions in the formation and evolution of contrail ice particles immediately after the engine-exit plane is still limited. In this work, we apply a microphysical parcel modeling approach to study the microphysics of ice particle formation in near-field aircraft plumes up to 1000 m downstream of an aircraft engine at cruise. The results from our microphysical calculations are presented.\\n\\n## 2 Microphysical model for ice particle formation',\n",
       " 'We apply the microphysical parcel model we developed previously (Brown et al., 1996; Wong et al., 2008) to study ice particle formation in near-field aircraft plumes at cruise. Our model tracks time evolution of a gaseous or a particle species in a jet engine exhaust in terms of contributions of chemistry, plume dilution and mixing, and microphysical processes as (Karcher, 1998a):\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\frac{dX_{i}}{dt} =\\\\frac{dX_{i}}{dt}\\\\bigg{|}_{\\\\rm chemistry}+\\\\frac{dX_{i}}{dt} \\\\bigg{|}_{\\\\rm mixing}+\\\\frac{dX_{i}}{dt}\\\\bigg{|}_{\\\\rm microphysics} \\\\tag{1}\\\\]\\n\\nThe contribution of chemistry comes from the chemical molar production rates of gaseous species. In our model, we use a gas-phase reaction mechanism consisting of 35 chemical species and 181 chemical reactions, which was derived from the NO\\\\({}_{\\\\rm x}\\\\) and SO\\\\({}_{\\\\rm x}\\\\) combustion mechanism by Muller et al. (2000) and the H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\) formation pathway reported in our previous study (Brown et al., 1996).

       " 'To simplify our calculations, the homogeneous H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O droplets produced in our simulations are not allowed to freeze. This is because these small homogeneous droplets are very acidic and their composition dependent freezing temperatures, based on the phase diagram reported by Gable et al. (1950), are lower than the ambient temperature of interest in this study. This treatment is also consistent with the slow homogeneous freezing rates calculated by the parameterized classical theory of homogeneous freezing (Tabazadeh et al., 1997). Previous microphysical calculations (Karcher, 1998a; Karcher et al., 1996; Pruppacher and Klett, 1997) suggest that heterogeneous freezing, rather than homogeneous freezing, is the main driving force to form contrail ice particles. Using the modified classical theory of heterogeneous freezing, these calculations show that liquid coated soot particles with a size of 20 nm and a contact angle of 50\\\\({}^{\\\\circ}\\\\) would induce heterogeneous freezing in a very short time scale of 10\\\\({}^{-2}\\\\) s (\\\\(\\\\sim\\\\)2.5-5 m in distance) after 70 m downstream. These calculations, as well as our modeling results, also show that soot surface coverage by liquid coatings is generally less than 30% before freezing in a typical aircraft plume at cruise for typical fuel sulfur contents. Rate estimation for heterogeneous ice nucleation on soot cores remains uncertain (Karcher et al., 1996) and only parametric studies are possible. For this reason, we assume coatings on soot particles only freeze heterogeneously as soon as plume temperature drops below their freezing temperatures, which are determined by their sulfate mass fraction based on the phase diagram reported by Gable et al. (1950). Although this approximation gives us an upper',\n",

       " 'Enhancement of nucleation rates by organic species has been shown in the laboratory (Zhang et al., 2004). Recent field campaigns measuring aircraft emissions at ground-level also demonstrate that this process may be important especially at low to mid power range where significantly more organic emissions are present in the gas and condensed phases (Knighton et al., 2007; Yelvington et al., 2007). However, knowledge of nucleation or particle growth enhanced by organic species is still limited, as are the species involved and the process by which the organic compounds contribute to the aerosol growth. Due to this reason, we do not explicitly consider the effects of organic species in these calculations. The entrainment of ambient particles is also neglected in this work because the concentration of ambient particles in the soot-rich regime is much smaller than the aircraft emitted particles in near-field aircraft plumes with a downstream distance smaller than 1000 m. Although our model may not capture all the microphysical details, we believe that our modeling results will provide valuable information to understand the parametric effects of contrail ice particle formation from aircraft emissions at cruise. The simulation results are also a good source for interpreting current measurement data.\\n\\nAtmos. Chem.

As illustrated in the figure, the nucleation of homogeneous H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O particles takes place as sulfuric acid and water supersaturation is highest about 30 m downstream. It is known that the acidity of homogeneous H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O particles increases with decreasing particle size (Yu, 2005), and particles that are more acidic have lower freezing temperatures (Gable et al., 1950). As a result, small volatile particles formed from homogeneous nucleation are too acidic to freeze when water supersaturation is above 100%. After water supersaturation drops below 100%, additional water condensation on liquid particle surface to have significant particle growth becomes thermodynamically unfavorable. In contrast, coatings on soot particles begin to freeze after about 30 m downstream (Fig. 1e), and ice coated soot particles grow to a size of around 1 m at 1000 m downstream (Fig. 1d). The growth of these particles is the most rapid in the first 100 m, especially in between 30-50 m, where the particle growth is driven mostly by the supersaturation of water vapor emitted from the engines. The ice particle growth after 100 m is more moderate compared to the first 100 m and is driven by the modest supersaturation of water with respect to ice affected by ambient relative humidity levels. Our simulation results suggest that ice particles are mainly formed by water condensation on emitted soot particles under this condition, which is consistent with the modeling results in the soot-rich regime (EI\\\\({}_{N}>1\\\\times 10^{15}\\\\) (kg-fuel)\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\)) by Karcher',\n",

Our results are also agreeable with the laboratory findings in freezing experiments of soot particles immersed in water droplets that heterogeneous freezing on soot surfaces is more favorable than homogeneous freezing of unseeded water droplets (Popovicheva et al., 2008). Note that the ice particle size distributions predicted from our model become narrower at later plume ages (Fig. 1e). As will be discussed in the next section, our model approaches dilution using the profiles based on locally averaged plume properties along the trajectories. As a result, the effects of turbulence on the evolution of contrail ice particles are not considered. Therefore, the variances of the contrail ice particle size distributions predicted from our model are likely underestimated, especially at later plume ages.',\n",

The ambient conditions of these cases are listed in Table 2 of their paper, and the model predicted particle size distributions using these conditions are compared with the measurement data in Fig. 2. As shown in the figure, our model is able to predict the mean size of the contrail ice particles for the cases studied. However, the model predicted much narrower particle size distributions than the measurements. As mentioned briefly earlier and as will be discussed in detail in the next section, our model only tracks ice particle formation using the dilution profile based on locally averaged plume properties along the trajectories.

The Davidson and Wang algorithm describes the behavior of a nonbuoyant discharge in a coflowing ambient fluid, and was found to be able to capture the dilution behavior of near-field aircraft plumes at ground-level at 30 m downstream very well (Wong et al., 2008). As shown in Fig. 3a, the exhaust dilution profile estimated from the Davidson and Wang algorithm under the same ambient and engine operating conditions is faster than that is determined from the Schumann equation. The final exhaust mass fraction at 1000 m downstream is also lower (\\\\(\\\\sim\\\\)0.5% compared to \\\\(\\\\sim\\\\)2%). To eliminate the effects of different dilution level at the end of 1000 m, we also introduced a hybrid profile of the two, which approximates the fast dilution of the Davidson and Wang profile in the first 500 m but approaches the final dilution level of the Schumann profile at the end of the 1000 m.',\n",
       " 'The predicted values of geometric mean diameter of the ice coated soot particles using different dilution profiles are shown in Fig. 3b. Although dilution is faster (and thus plume temperature also drops faster) for the Davidson and Wang profile, the rapid particle growth starts earlier when the Schumann profile is used. This is because higher water vapor concentration in the Schumann profile enables the exhaust to reach water vapor supersaturation sooner at a warmer temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3c. The final particle size is slightly smaller when the Davidson and Wang profile is used. This is because the dilution level at 1000 m downstream is larger in this case and there is less available water vapor for condensation. On the other hand, the final particle size for the hybrid profile approaches the prediction for the Schumann equation, suggesting that differences in the dilution trajectories in the first 500 m only affects the onset of particle growth, but final particle size is determined by final dilution levels. This is consistent with the assumption that contrail ice particle formation is a thermodynamically controlled process.',\n",

Because both the Schumann equation and the Davidson and Wang algorithm are set up to match plume properties more than one wingspan downstream, they do not capture the behavior of the potential core region (\\\\(<\\\\)15 m downstream) well. This results in the bended lines in the high temperature (\\\\(>\\\\)300 K), potential core region.\\n\\nSince our microphysical model only tracks particle evolution using the dilution profiles based on locally averaged plume properties along the trajectories, treatments of ambient air entrainment, turbulent mixing, and vortex interactions are extremely simplified. As a result, our modeling results may not capture the inhomogeneity of plume mixing in the radial directions. Although we anticipate the impact of mixing is smaller in the near-field (\\\\(<\\\\)5 s), this simplification of mixing treatment still may contribute to uncertainties of our model predictions. As mentioned in the previous section, one possible uncertainty may be the predicted variances (width) of the ice particle size distributions, since we may not capture all the particles experiencing different dilution histories. Further microphysical calculations using selected dilution trajectories from high-fidelity calculations, such as large eddy simulations, are necessary to quantify the effect of mixing profiles on contrail ice particle formation.\\n\\n### Effects of ion-mediated nucleation',\n",
       " 'The effects of ion-mediated nucleation have been studied extensively in the literature. It is believed that ions present in aircraft emissions at cruise have great impacts on homogeneous nucleation and formation on volatile sulfuric acid-water aerosols. However, their contribution to the formation of contrail ice particles is still uncertain. Here, we investigated the effects of ion-mediated nucleation on the formation of ice coated soot particles, as shown in Fig. 4. The ion-mediated nucleation model developed by Yu (2006b) was incorporated, and the same conditions used in Fig. 1 were chosen for Fig. 4. The initial ion concentration was assumed to come from ionization of 1% of the initial sulfuric acid concentration (\\\\(\\\\sim\\\\)7.5\\\\(\\\\times\\\\)10\\\\({}^{17}\\\\) (kg-fuel)\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\) for both positive and negative ions). As shown in the figure, the presence of chemi-ions does speed up the nucleation rates of homogeneous H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O particles, as evidenced by significant enhancement of embryo and droplet size and concentration (Fig. 4a and b). However, freezing of these larger liquid H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O particles formed from ion-mediated nucleation are still unfavorable such that their contribution to ice particle growth is limited. As a result, the growth of ice coated soot particles is not affected, as shown in Fig. 4c, and no significant increase of the ice particle size was observed with the addition of chemi-ions. Our modeling results suggest that the presence of chemi-ions in the soot-rich regime does not significantly contribute to the formation of additional ice nuclei to alter ice particle growth.\\n\\n### Effects of ambient relative humidity and fuel sulfur contents',\n",
       " 'Figure 5 shows the effects of ambient relative humidity with respect to ice (RHI) on ice coated soot particle size distributions. Four different levels of ambient RHI were studied in this work: 110%, 100%, 90%, and 80%. As shown in the figure, the growth of ice coated soot particles is most rapid in between 30-50 m downstream regardless ambient RHI levels. In this region, the effect of ambient RHI is negligible\\n\\nFigure 4: Simulation results for ion-mediated homogeneous H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O nucleation under the same condition as Fig. 1: **(a)** concentration and size evolution of volatile H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O droplets; **(b)** concentration and size evolution of volatile H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O embryos smaller than 40 acid molecules; **(c)** ice coated soot particle size distributions as a function of downstream distance with or without ion-mediated nucleation.\\n\\nbecause the particle growth is driven by water vapor emitted from aircraft engines. At 1000 m downstream, the ice coated soot particles under higher ambient RHI become slightly larger than those under lower ambient RHI. However, this difference is still quite small because the difference in ice supersaturation in the exhaust plume due to ambient is within 1% for such a short plume age (\\\\(\\\\sim\\\\)4 s). This further confirms that ice particle growth in the first 1000 m is driven by emitted water vapor condensation whereas ice particle growth afterwards is driven by ambient relative humidity.',\n",
       " 'Figure 6a shows the effects of fuel sulfur content (FSC) on particle size distributions of ice coated particles as a function of downstream distance. The same conditions in Fig. 1 were modeled, and two additional fuel sulfur levels, 200 ppm and 800 ppm by weight, were studied. Our calculation results show that the growth of ice coated soot particles is initially slower when fuel sulfur is lower at a downstream distance of around 32.5 m. This is because lower fuel sulfur levels give lower initial SO3 and H2SO4 concentrations. As a result, a smaller fraction of the soot surface is activated by SO3 and\\n\\nFigure 5: Effects of ambient relative humidity with respect to ice (RHI) on ice particle size distributions at downstream distances of 32.5 m, 35 m, 50 m, and 1000 m.\\n\\nFigure 6: Effects of fuel sulfur content (FSC) on: (**a**) ice particle size distributions at downstream distances of 32.5 m, 35 m, 50 m, and 1000 m; (**b**) sulfur activated fraction on soot surface.',\n",
       " 'H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\) as illustrated in Fig. 6b and the modeling results by Karcher (1998a). This can be explained by the relationship between soot surface coverage (\\\\(\\\\theta\\\\)) and H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\) concentration (\\\\(C_{a}\\\\)) in Eq. (6). Smaller activated area on soot surface effectively reduces water condensation rate on soot surface when the particles are small. When particles grow to a size that is much larger than the cores, however, the fraction of the activated soot surface becomes relatively unimportant because of much larger available ice surface area. In this case, the growth of ice coated soot particles is faster when fuel sulfur is lower, since binary homogeneous nucleation is not depleting water as effectively without enough SO\\\\({}_{3}\\\\) and H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\) in the gas phase, resulting in higher water vapor concentration (and hence higher water supersaturation). This difference, however, is very small between FSCs of 200 ppm and 800 ppm (Fig. 6a), since our model predicts that only slightly larger particles are formed for a fuel sulfur level of 200 ppm at a downstream distance of 1000 m. Our modeling results are consistent with experimental findings (Schumann et al., 2002) where no significant effect of fuel sulfur content on contrail formation was observed.\\n\\n### Effects of soot emissions',\n",
       " 'Studies on the effects of soot emissions on contrail ice particle properties are very limited in the literature. To our knowledge, the recent paper by Karcher and Yu (2009) is the only modeling work that attempts to perform systematic studies on the roles of soot emissions in the formation and evolution of young contrails. It is suggested in their work that in the soot-rich regime (EI\\\\({}_{N}>\\\\)1\\\\(\\\\times\\\\)10\\\\({}^{15}\\\\) (kg-fuel)\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\)) ice particles mainly form by freezing of water around soot cores, whereas in the soot-poor regime (EI\\\\({}_{N}<\\\\)1\\\\(\\\\times\\\\)10\\\\({}^{13}\\\\) (kg-fuel)\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\)) ice particles mainly originate from liquid particles without soot cores. In this paper, we performed a similar parametric study to investigate the effects of initial number concentration and particle size distribution of soot emissions. We focus our work on the soot-rich regime, since it corresponds to the soot emissions from existing aircraft technology.',\n",
       " 'Figure 7 shows the effects of initial number concentration of soot particles on ice particle size distributions in the aircraft exhaust up to 1000 m downstream. Three different initial number loadings of soot particles were studied, and our simulation results show that size of ice coated soot particles at 1000 m downstream decreases with increasing initial soot concentration. This is because more soot particles are competing for water vapor and a smaller amount of water is condensed on each soot particle when initial soot concentration is higher. Note that when initial soot concentration is 5\\\\(\\\\times\\\\)10\\\\({}^{7}\\\\) cc\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\) (Fig. 7c), a bimodal particle size distribution is predicted from our calculation after 35 m downstream. The smaller mode of this particle size distribution represents those liquid coated soot particles. Because of\\n\\nthe Kelvin effect and the smaller available surface area, the amount of water condensation on these liquid soot particles is smaller, resulting in more acidic coatings on them. Similar to homogeneous H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O particles formed from nucleation, these liquid particles are too acidic to freeze when water supersaturation is above 100%. After water supersaturation drops below 100% (even though RHI is above 100%), water condensation on liquid particle surface becomes thermodynamically unfavorable to grow into larger size. This prediction is consistent with the experimental findings by Popovicheva et al. (2008), where they suggested that hydrophilic coverage (e.g. sulfuric acid) on the hydrophobic soot surface higher than a threshold value could inhibit ice nucleation due to effective dissolution of water in the soluble surface coverage, reducing the likelihood of freezing of the solution.',\n",
       " 'Figure 8 shows the effects of initial soot particle size on the growth of ice coated soot particles in the aircraft exhaust up to 1000 m downstream. Three different particle size distributions of soot cores were initialized for calculations, and our simulation results show that smaller soot cores result in more liquid particles and fewer but larger ice particles. This is because liquid particles in the smaller mode of the bimodal particle size distribution are too acidic to freeze, and fewer soot particles in the large mode can serve as ice nuclei to compete for water vapor condensation. The resulting particle size distribution of ice coated soot particles is also broader for smaller soot cores since the split between the two modes are more marked.',\n",
       " 'Our above simulation results are agreeable with the modeling results by Karcher et al. (1996), where they observed that an initial ice nuclei number density of \\\\(10^{5}\\\\) cm\\\\({}^{-3}\\\\) would result in smaller maximum ice particle size but larger optical depth than an initial ice nuclei number density of \\\\(10^{3}\\\\) cm\\\\({}^{-3}\\\\). Our results are also generally consistent with the modeling results in the soot-rich regime by Karcher and Yu (2009). The effects of initial soot number concentration and initial soot core size observed in our model suggest that sufficiently high soot core number concentration and sufficiently small soot core size that were not investigated in Karcher and Yu (2009) may be able to suppress ice particle growth. To validate this assumption, we performed a microphysical parcel calculation initialized with a hypothetical soot core number concentration of \\\\(1\\\\times 10^{10}\\\\) cc\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\) (EI\\\\({}_{N}\\\\)=4.6\\\\(\\\\times 10^{18}\\\\) (kg-fuel)\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\)) and a GMD of soot core size distribution of 5 nm. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 9. In this case, no significant ice particle growth is predicted from the model because all the particles are too acidic to freeze and are \"trapped\" in the liquid phase, limiting significant particle growth. The results shown in Fig. 9 suggest that ice particle growth could be suppressed\\n\\nFigure 8: Effects of initial soot core size on size distributions of ice coated soot particles as a function of downstream distance (\\\\(x\\\\)) when geometric mean diameter (GMD) of initial particle size distribution of soot cores is: **(a)** 20 nm; **(b)** 40 nm; **(c)** 80 nm.',\n",
       " 'by a high number concentration of sufficiently small contrail particle nuclei in aircraft emissions. Although existing engine technology does not produce such soot particles, our findings suggest that manipulation of the number and size of contrail particle nucleation sites may affect contrail properties and offers possibilities for potential mitigation. Further laboratory studies and field measurements are clearly needed to validate the above implication.\\n\\n## 4 Conclusions',\n",
       " 'To gain systematic understanding of parametric effects of variables affecting contrail ice particle formation, we apply a microphysical parcel modeling approach to study microphysics of contrail ice particle formation in near-field aircraft plumes in the soot-rich regime (soot number emission index \\\\(>\\\\)1\\\\(\\\\times\\\\)10\\\\({}^{15}\\\\) (kg-fuel)\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\)) at cruise. Our calculations suggest that ice particles are mainly formed by water condensation on emitted soot particles in this regime. The growth of ice coated soot particles is more rapid in the 100 m downstream of an engine and is driven by water emissions. After 100 m downstream, the size of ice particles is mostly affected by ambient relative humidity with respect to ice but the effect of ambient relative humidity in the first 1000 m downstream remains insignificant. The presence of chemi-ions speeds up the nucleation rates of homogeneous H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)SO\\\\({}_{4}\\\\)-H\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)O particles, but the growth of ice coated soot particles is not affected since these homogeneous particles are too acidic to freeze and do not serve as ice nuclei. The effect of fuel sulfur content is small, and our calculations show that only slightly larger particles at 1000 m downstream are formed for a lower fuel sulfur level at 200 ppm by weight. The initial properties of soot emissions play the most critical role, and our calculations show that higher initial number concentrations of contrail particle nuclei result in smaller ice particles. In addition, a bimodal particle size distribution consisting of smaller liquid particles and larger ice particles is predicted when initial number concentration of soot cores is sufficiently high. Initializing with smaller soot particles also results in more liquid particles in the smaller mode of the',\n",

Hygroscopic seeding for rain enhancement in convective clouds is aimed at accelerating autoconversion, i.e., the conversion of cloud water to precipitation. This was reviewed extensively by Bruintjes (1999) and Silverman (2003). Three main conceptual models have guided the hygroscopic seeding experiments:\\n\\n* _The rain embryo particles_: Seeding with ultra-giant CCN (size \\\\(>\\\\)10 um), which serve as embryos for rain-drops.\\n* _The tail effect_: Seeding with giant CCN (diameter between 1 and 10 um) adds drops to the large end tail of the DSD, and hence accelerates the further widening of the DSD and leads to formation of rain drops (Segal et al., 2004).\\n* _The competition effect_: Seeding with giant or large CCN (diameter near 1 um), for greater competition for the vapor, decreasing peak super saturation at cloud base, and hence reducing cloud drop number concentrations and broadening the cloud drop size distribution (DSD). This causes larger drops that coalesce faster into rain drops (Cooper et al., 1997).',\n",
       " 'The seeding practice with hygroscopic flares became fashionable after the reports of the apparent success of the South African (Mather et al., 1997) and Mexican (WMO, 2000; Bruintjes et al., 2001) experiments, and the simulations with theoretical support for the efficacy of the flares (Cooper et al., 1997). Mather et al. (1997) showed an isolated case where the DSD within a small volume of a cloud base was widened in the just-seeded concentrated seeded plume of the flares, and argued that this was caused by the competition effect. The operational practice has been to seed the updraft just below cloud base with one to two 1-kg hygroscopic flares that burn in about 4 minutes. This means a seeding rate of 0.25 to 0.5 kg/min or, with an air speed of 70 ms\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\), a rate of 0.015-0.03 kg km\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\) of seeding path. This practice prevails even though demonstration of its efficacy is lacking. Furthermore, Segal et al. (2004) calculated the particle size distribution of hygroscopic aerosols that would accelerate the conversion of cloud water to rain drops for the least amount of salt mass, and showed that this was quite different from the particle size distribution that is produced by burning hygroscopic flares. Rosenfeld et al. (2010) followed this up and manufactured a salt powder that matched the optimal particle size distribution as calculated by Segal et al. (2004), and tested it against hygroscopic flares in actual cloud seeding experiments. The results of Rosenfeld et al. (2010) support the simulations of Segal et al. (2004) and show that to produce a microphysical seeding effect on clouds that is detectable by cloud physics aircraft, a mass concentration greater by an order of magnitude than is presently practiced with hygroscopic flares has to be dispersed.',\n",
       " 'This paper presents the results of experimental and theoretical studies of cloud modification with the salt powder developed by Lahav and Rosenfeld (2005) and Rosenfeld et al. (2010) for obtaining additional precipitation amounts from convective clouds. Experiments were carried out in the cloud chamber of the Research and Production Association \"Typhoon\", Russia, under the conditions corresponding to the formation of convective clouds, as described in Sect. 2. The observed changes of the cloud microstructure at different seeding rates in the cloud chamber are given in Sect. 3. The conversion of cloud water into rain could not be fully documented even in this big cloud chamber due to sedimentation of the large cloud drops. The implication with respect to conversion of the cloud water to rainfall had to be assessed by a 1-dimensional cloud model, which replicated the observed initial spectra and extended the calculations through the formation of rain. This was done both for the salt powder and for other hygroscopic agents with narrow particle size distributions, as described in Sect. 4. The conclusions, given in Sect. 5, provide the particle size distribution and seeding rates that would result in the fastest conversion of cloud water to rainfall for a range of seeding rates of the hygroscopic seeding agents. It should be noted here that the fastest conversion of cloud water to rainfall does not always mean also the greatest amount of precipitation (Rosenfeld et al., 2008). Establishing the seeding effects on precipitation requires randomized seeding experiments in the natural atmospheric conditions accompanied by detailed microphysical measurements and model simulations.\\n\\n## 2 The big cloud chamber and its usage for measurements in aerosol and cloud media',\n",
       " 'Experimental studies of a salt powder seeding effect on a cloud medium were performed in the Big Cloud Chamber (BCC) of RPA \"Typhoon\". BCC is designed for modeling convective or stratified clouds and fogs of different origin under the conditions close to those in the real atmosphere. The chamber is a steel airtight cylinder of 18-m height and 15 m diameter. The chamber walls of 6-mm thickness are externally heat-insulated. The total volume of the chamber is 3200 m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\). A cloud medium is formed up to a height of 15 m. The technological compartment separated by a metallic grating is located above. A detailed description of the BCC and the methods of cloud media formation in it are presented in (Romanov and Zhukov, 2000).',\n",
       " 'The process of convective cloud medium formation in the BCC is made through air expansion. For this, external air is pumped into the chamber. As a result the air pressure in it is increased to a certain level. The air pressure decrease is made by opening holes in the upper part of the chamber. The air discharge from the chamber through the holes of different cross sections makes it possible to regulate the rate of pressure decrease in the chamber, thus setting a certain velocity of air updraft in the atmosphere during the formation of a convective cloud. The program controlling pressure decreasing in the BCC makes it possible to realize a preset scenario of air mass updraft in the atmosphere with equivalent rates of 0.1-10 ms\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\). Air temperature, pressure, humidity and the chamber wall temperatures are basic parameters for setting thermodynamic conditions in the BCC. These parameters are continuously measured during the experiments in the BCC. For setting the conditions of cloud medium formation thermodynamic relationships and the known heat exchange coefficients for the BCC are used (Romanov and Zhukov, 2000). The initial stage of cloud formation is simulated in the BCC at updraft velocities usually of 1-2 ms\\\\({}^{-1}\\\\) for warm continental clouds. The cloud drop size distribution formed is determined by the physicochemical properties of condensation nuclei and the water vapor supersaturation in the chamber. The cloud drop concentration depends on maximum supersaturation. Water vapor supersaturation is not measured in the BCC, but in our experiments realized are cloud drop concentrations observed in continental convective clouds.',\n",
       " 'In the efforts described in this paper the pressure decrease in the BCC was made from the initial value of 1300 hPa with the velocity of air mass updraft in the atmosphere of 1.2-1.3 m/s. Relative humidity of air in the chamber before the pressure drop is usually 90-96%. The air temperature is 22-25 \\\\({}^{\\\\circ}\\\\)C. At such values of meteorological parameters a cloud medium in the BCC is formed in 2 min after the beginning of the pressure lowering (see Fig. 1). By this time the air humidity attains 100%.

This period lasts \\\\(\\\\approx\\\\)12 min. during which the equivalent velocity of air updraft decreases to \\\\(\\\\approx\\\\)0.9 m/s. Just during this period the process of cloud medium formation in the BCC may be considered adequate to the process of convective cloud formation in the real atmosphere.\\n\\nAs the total heat capacity of the BCC walls is by about 10 times greater than the total heat capacity of air in the chamber, the evolution of the cloud medium is strongly affected by the processes of air heat exchange with the chamber walls.

       " 'For measurements of cloud medium microstructure the BBC is equipped with the photoelectric particle analyzer developed at the RPA \"Typhonon\" (Romanov, 1991). This device is based on measurements of light scattered from particles at an angle of 90\\\\({}^{\\\\circ}\\\\). The principle of operation of the analyzers is in the analysis of amplitudes of pulses of light scattered from single particles at their flight through the measuring volume. An electric filament lamp is used as a white light source. The light flux from the lamp is focused by a round lens on its axis. The light scattered from a drop in the lens focus is collected by the round lens and directed to the photodetector. The angle between the axes of the illuminating and the positive lenses makes 90\\\\({}^{\\\\circ}\\\\). The principle of drop sizes measurements is in the measurement of the intensity of light scattered by a drop and the use of the calculated dependences of scattered light intensity on a drop size. For this, the operating characteristic of the device is calculated. The operating characteristics of such devices are calculated with the Mie scattering theory for spherical particles (Heyder and Gebhart, 1979; Singh et al., 1982). The angular apertures of the light source and of the light detector are taken into consideration. The lamp radiation spectrum and the photodetector spectral sensitivity are also taken into account.

First a cloud medium on natural condensation nuclei was formed in the BCC, and during about 20 min measurements of the background cloud medium parameters were made. Then the pumping of the chamber up to the initial high pressure was repeated and salt particles were injected into it. The spraying of the salt powder from an airplane in the cloud was simulated by a pneumatic atomizing nozzle (like a spraying can). With the help of fans the aerosol was uniformly mixed inside the chamber. At the moment of the beginning of pressure decrease the fans are switched off.

By this, the conditions of particles introduction into the subcloud layer of a convective cloud were simulated. Then, the process of lowering air pressure in the chamber was repeated, and the parameters of the cloud medium formed as a result of aerosol particles impact were measured. The modification effect was assessed from the results of comparing the parameters of the cloud medium with the corresponding parameters during the background experiment.

       " 'As it has been mentioned above, in the BCC the initial stage of convective cloud microstructure formation is modeled. The simulation of the raindrop embryo effect is likely to be impossible. But, as it is shown in (Drofa, 2006), the transformation of a cloud drop spectrum as a result of the introduction of hygroscopic particles at the initial stage of cloud formation plays the crucial role in the effect of modification. The size spectrum of the droplets formed in the initial stage of cloud origination determines the subsequent development of cloud microstructure, rate of large drop formation, development of coagulation processes and precipitation formation. This Section presents the measurement results of changes of the cloud microstructure in the cloud chamber at the introduction of the salt powder and the estimations of the impact of the salt powder based on the observed changes of the cloud microstructure.\\n\\nThe evolution of the cloud drop size spectra obtained with the use of a photoelectric meter in the BCC is shown in Fig. 3. Here presented are typical cloud drop spectra determined at different time steps after the formation of a cloud medium during the background experiments. The time starts from the moment of the cloud medium formation. At the chosen mode of air pressure lowering a cloud medium with the drop concentration from 1300 to 1550 cm\\\\({}^{-3}\\\\) is formed. The liquid water content of the medium grows linearly with time and by 12 min it becomes equal to 0.8 g/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\).

The modal size of the cloud drops that formed in the BCC appear to be nucleated on the background condensation nuclei. The temporal character of variation of this spectrum range does not practically differ from the behavior of spectra obtained during the background experiment. From the graphs in Fig. 4 it is seen that the introduction of such an amount of salt particles manifests itself only in the large-drop fraction of the cloud drop spectrum. A \"tail\" of large drops that formed on the added salt particles appeared on the drop size distribution that was measured already at the first 2 minutes after cloud formation. In the spectra measured after 4 minutes of the cloud medium existence the large-drop \"tail\" of the distribution appears to be truncated due to gravitation-induced sedimentation of the largest drops onto the BCC floor. Actually, the terminal sedimentation rate of drops with the radii of, for example, 30 \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)m, is equal to 11 cm/s. At the height of the BCC working volume of 15 meters all the drops of such sizes formed at this level fall onto the floor of the BCC during 2.5 min. The duration of the settling process of drops with radii of 20 \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)m takes about 5 minutes. It is clear that the life-time of such drops formed at the lower levels of the BCC is much shorter.

In this case the cloud droplets formed on the background aerosol particles are smaller in size as compared to the background experiment. This effect is explained by a decrease of water vapor supersaturation in the cloud medium at the introduction of the given amount of salt particles.

This is the \"tail effect\", as defined in the introduction. As has been mentioned earlier, the drop spectra obtained in the BCC are \"truncated\" in the large-drop-spectrum range because of the settling of drops onto the BCC floor, so that the \"rain embryo\" effect cannot be properly simulated in the experiment.

       " 'To overcome the effect of truncation of the drop size distribution by sedimentation and to assess the efficiency of hygroscopic agents with rather wide particle size distribution functions (one of them is the salt powder under study), simulation studies are needed. In this paper we shall theoretically study the efficiency of cloud modification by the salt powder with the use of a one-dimensional convective cloud model developed by Drofa (2007, 2008, 2010). In these articles, an analysis of evolution of cloud microstructure and precipitation in response to the introduction of hygroscopic particles is made, and the efficiency of hygroscopic seeding of clouds is studied depending on cloud parameters and physicochemical properties of the hygroscopic agent. Similar studies made with the use of a 3-D model are made in the recently published paper (Kuba and Mukaram, 2010). The results of this work are in complete agreement with the conclusions drawn earlier. As in all the works cited in the given paper that concern numerical simulation of hygroscopic seeding of clouds, the 1-dimensional numerical model presented does not consider ice processes. Therefore, the conclusions are limited to the effects of hygroscopic aerosols on initiating warm rain. In tropical and sub-tropical summer convective clouds the distance between cloud base an the 0 \\\\({}^{\\\\circ}\\\\)C isotherm level can reach 4 km, with additional 1-2 km of supercooled cloud above this level, where precipitation initiation is dominated by warm rain processes.',\n",
       " 'The 1-dimensional numerical model describes the evolution of a cloud medium in the central part of an axisymmetric warm convective cloud at a preset variable with height velocity of an air updraft forming the cloud. The equation system is used for temperature and air pressure changes and for water vapor supersaturation at air mass lifting. Entrainment of heat and water vapor into a lifting air parcel from the environment is accounted for parametrically (as in Pruppacher and Klett, 1997). The value of the entrainment coefficient is taken inversely proportional to the altitude above the cloud base. Adjustment of parameters characterizing entrainment gives a possibility to achieve a complete matching of vertical profiles of cloud parameters obtained in the model with the parameters of continental clouds in the real atmospheric conditions (Mazin and Shmeter, 1983; Shmeter, 1987).\\n\\nThe vertical profile of vertical air velocity is prescribed in the numerical model and does not change between the stages of cloud development. To describe the air updraft velocity vertical profile a universal function considering basic regularities of air vertical fluxes in continental convective clouds (Shmeter, 1987) is applied. The velocity of an air updraft at the cloud base is set to 1.5 m/s. It increases proportionally to altitude in the lower half of the cloud. Maximum velocity is achieved at the half cloud height. It is proportional to the cloud thickness. At a cloud thickness of 4 km it reaches about 5 m/s. In the cloud upper half the updraft velocity drops gradually to zero. The altitude at which the updraft velocity is equal to zero is determined by the cloud thickness.',\n",
       " 'Limitation of growth of the convective cloud upwards occurs due to the existence in the atmosphere of a barrier layer with isothermality and inversion of air temperatures. The height of this layer above the cloud base determines the height of maximum liquid water content in the cloud. In the numerical model, the atmospheric barrier layer is simulated by the introduction at a certain level above the cloud base of water vapor sub-saturation, as far as low air relative humidity has a governing role in the cloud medium evolution. The altitude of the barrier layer above the cloud base is preset at the level of 0.8 of the cloud thickness. This corresponds to the parameters of moderate convective clouds observed in real atmospheric conditions. Above this level the cloud top is formed, where fine cloud droplets evaporate and the large drops precipitate into the lower cloud layers.',\n",

At a further lifting of the cloud medium only the process of drop condensation growth/evaporation occurs. New cloud drops do not form.

With the use of the initial conditions of the air mass state and the parameters of condensation nuclei (atmospheric and/or additionally introduced), the size distribution function of drops originated at the cloud base is calculated according to the method used in (Drofa, 2006). Further evolution of the size distribution function is calculated with the use of the kinetic equation. The model contains a precise description of warm rain microphysics.

For a numeric solution of the kinetic equation a fixed grid of cloud drop sizes in the radius range of 1-2500 \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)m (396 points) with a non-uniform step in radii was used. Sedimentation of drops and precipitation are computed from the difference of terminal falling velocities of drops of different radii and the rate of the air mass updraft.

At such a concentration, as is seen from Fig. 8, the effect of salt particles reveals itself only in the large drop \"tail\" of cloud drop distribution range without changes in the spectrum of drops formed on atmospheric condensation nuclei. The same character of cloud drop spectrum variations is observed in experimentally obtained spectra measured in the BCC at a very similar concentration of the salt powder introduced (see Fig. 4). The difference is observed only toward smaller droplet sizes - the experimental spectra are broader. On the whole, the problem \"to broaden spectra\" needs special detailed',\n",
       " 'studies. One of possible causes of such a discrepancy may be in differences of physical and chemical characteristics of atmospheric condensation nuclei in particle size distributions. In the BCC only the size distributions of all aerosol particles were measured. But this distribution can concern a mixture of particles with rather different properties.',\n",
       " 'The calculation results of drop spectra in the convective cloud after 120 s at the introduction of different amounts of the salt powder into the subcloud layer are presented in Fig. 9. The atmospheric conditions are the same as in the case mentioned above. As it is seen from Fig. 9, at a small mass concentration of the powder, the introduction of such particles results only in the growth of the large-cloud drop fraction. This drop fraction is growing with increasing mass of the powder introduced. The shape of the drop spectrum formed on the background aerosol particles does not change at their mass concentration of the particles up to 1 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\).\\n\\nAt the concentrations of the salt powder higher than 1 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\) a decrease of the number of drops formed on atmospheric condensation nuclei occurs. This effect is also observed in the experimental data obtained at high concentrations of the salt powder (see Figs. 5 and 6 and Table 1). The effect is explained, as it has been mentioned earlier, by the fact that the introduction of larger amounts of salt particles decreases the supersaturation of water vapor. This causes a slower growth of drops formed on the background aerosol particles.',\n",
       " 'The evolution of the cloud drop size spectrum at the introduction of hygroscopic particles with a very narrow particle size distribution into the convective cloud sublayer is given as an example in Fig. 9 as well. In this case, the particles of NaCl with an effective radius of 1 um and a relative dispersion of the drop size spectrum \\\\(S\\\\) = 0.3 are introduced. The number concentration of the particles introduced is 120 cm\\\\({}^{-3}\\\\). This is an optimal concentration of particles of the given sizes for obtaining maximum effect of modification (Drofa, 2008). At higher or lower concentrations the modification effect decreases. The particle mass concentration is 1.1 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\). As is seen from Fig. 9, the result of the introduction of such particles is in the formation of a bimodal cloud drop spectrum. The large drop mode is governed by the growth of drops formed on salt particles. The small drop mode is formed on the background aerosol particles. Further, the bimodal character of the cloud drop spectrum is maintained in the quasi-equilibrium state.\\n\\nFigure 8: Evolution of simulated cloud drop spectrum at the introduction of salt powder with the mass concentration of 1 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\) (the numbers at the curves – time (min.) after the beginning of the cloud medium formation).',\n",
       " 'The studies of the modification effect induced by such particles have shown (Segal et al., 2004, 2007; Drofa, 2006) that the introduction of salt particles can accelerate warm rain processes by the competition effect, which decreases the water vapor supersaturation in the cloud. In turn, the number of atmospheric nuclei is activated (i.e. they turn into cloud drops) to a lesser degree than in the background not seeded cloud. As a result, the total concentration of cloud drops formed on the background and additional seeded nuclei appears less than in the case when additional seeded particles are absent. Average sizes of the seeded cloud drops become larger. Due to this, a positive effect of modification by hygroscopic particles on a cloud with narrow drop size distributions is attained, because the enlargement of cloud drops is the major factor stimulating gravitation-induced coagulation in clouds and subsequent precipitation formation. One should pay attention to the fact that the cloud drops formed on the background aerosol particles in the seeded cloud are smaller in size as compared to those in the not seeded cloud. It means that in this case the impact of salt particles leads to changes in the conditions of cloud drop formation on background condensation nuclei.',\n",
       " 'Modification made by the salt powder does not result in such changes even at rather high mass concentrations of the powder introduced. The number of cloud drops formed on background aerosol particles changes little here. As the analysis of the results of numerical simulations demonstrate, the modification by the salt powder causes a higher intensification of coagulation processes in the cloud than at the modification by hygroscopic particles with narrow size distributions. This can be explained by the fact that at the modification by the salt powder the drop spectrum is broadened only towards the large-drop fraction where coagulation is more efficient.\\n\\nThe data obtained at the initial stage of condensation (Fig. 9) are used as starting data for calculations of evolution of cloud medium microstructure with the one-dimensional numerical model of a convective cloud (Drofa, 2010). The calculation results for precipitation obtained with the model for clouds of different thicknesses at modification by different amounts of salt particles are shown in Fig. 10. The introduction of particles into the 60, 120 or 240 m subcloud layer is made at the 10th min. from the beginning of the cloud formation. The data given in the same figure for clouds without modification demonstrate that the significant precipitation quantities calculated with this model fall out from convective clouds with thicknesses over 3.5 km. This result is in agreement with the data of experimental studies of clouds in real atmospheric conditions (Mazin and Shmeter, 1983).',\n",
       " 'The results of numerical simulations show that the effect of modifying clouds with hygroscopic particles significantly depends on the cloud vertical thickness - the more the thickness, the greater the precipitation amounts are. The calculation data on the effect of the South African pyrotechnic flares particles show that significant additional precipitation amounts are observed only at modifying clouds with the thicknesses over 4 km. The calculations are made for the case of particles introduction into the layer with the thickness of 240 m at a mass concentration of particles of 0.05 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\) and the consumption of 12 kg of the agent per 1 km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\) of the seeded area. The use of smaller amounts of such particles does not lead to a discernible positive modification effect. The result presented is in agreement with the data of field experiments aimed at cloud modification with such particles (Mather et al., 1997; WMO, 2000; Bruintjes et al., 2001). In these experiments at comparable with the above-mentioned agent consumptions a 10-15% precipitation enhancement from the clouds of 6-km thicknesses was obtained.',\n",
       " 'Modeling was made for different mass concentrations of the salt powder with 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\). The results of numerical simulations demonstrated that the effect of modification by the salt powder is determined by the total amount of the powder introduced into subcloud layer. This means that at the introduction of the powder with the concentration of, for example, 0.1 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\) into the 120-m layer the same precipitation amount is observed as at the introduction of the powder with the concentration of 0.2 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\) into the 60-m layer. The amount of the agent at the given mass concentration is determined by the thickness of the layer into which the agent is introduced. So, at the introduction of the powder with the particle mass concentration of 0.1 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\) into the 120-m layer the consumption of the agent is 12 kg per 1 km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\) of the seeding area. At changing the layer thickness where the agent is introduced the agent consumption changes proportionally with the thickness of the layer.\\n\\nAs is seen from Fig. 10, seeding with salt powders results in a significant increase of precipitation amounts as compared to cloud modification by fine particles of the South African pyrotechnic flares. At the consumption of\\n\\nFigure 9: Simulated drop spectrum in the background cloud (1), at the introduction of salt particles with the radius of 1 μm with the mass concentrations of 1.1 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\) (2) and at the introduction of salt powder with the mass concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 5 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\) (curves 3–6, correspondingly).',\n",
       " '2.4 kg/km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\) of the salt powder the precipitation amounts falling from the clouds with the thicknesses over 4 km are greater than at cloud modification with the pyrotechnic flares (at the consumption of pyrotechnic particles of 12 kg/km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\)).\\n\\nThe modification effect obtained in case of a salt powder is also significantly higher than that achieved with larger salt particles with narrow particle size distributions. Fig. 10 gives the calculation results for precipitation at seeding with salt particles with effective radii of 1 um at optimal mass concentration 1.1 mg/m\\\\({}^{3}\\\\). The cloud drop spectrum at the initial stage of condensation at seeding by these particles is shown in Fig. 9. The consumption of the agent per 1 km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\) of the seeding area for such particles, when they are introduced into the 60-m subcloud layer, makes 64 kg. From Fig. 10 it is seen that at seeding with such particles the modification effect appears almost the same as in case of using the salt powder with its consumption of 12 kg/km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\). It means that the consumption of the salt powder is by 5 times less than that of the salt particles with the radii of 1 um.',\n",
       " 'The calculation results demonstrated that in case of cloud seeding with salt powders at their consumption of 24 kg/km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\), additional precipitation amounts may be obtained from clouds with 2.5 \\\\(<\\\\) \\\\(H\\\\) \\\\(<\\\\) 3.5 km. Such clouds are not giving significant precipitation under natural conditions. Maximum effect of modification - the greatest precipitation amounts - is realized at the consumption of 48 kg/km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\) of the salt powder (the upper curve in Fig. 10). Here, as the analysis of numerical simulation results shows, very few cloud drops remain in the cloud. Practically, almost all of the cloud water transforms into rain drops and precipitates. Therefore, a further increase in consumption of the agent (over 48 kg/km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\)) does not lead to a significant additional precipitation enhancement.\\n\\n## 5 Conclusions\\n\\nThe results of experiments carried out in the cloud chamber at the conditions corresponding to the formation of convective clouds have shown that:',\n",
       " '* The introduction of the salt powder before a cloud medium is formed results in the formation on the large-drop \"tail\" and in the broadening of drop size spectrum. This result is a positive factor for stimulating coagulation processes in clouds and for subsequent formation of precipitation in them.\\n* No impact is observed on the fine-droplet spectrum fraction formed on background condensation nuclei even at moderate amounts of the powder introduced.\\n* Seeding with the salt powder leads also to enlargement of the whole population of cloud drops and to a decrease of their total concentration as compared to the background cloud medium. With the introduction of increasing mass concentration of salt particles, this effect increases practically linearly. This factor also leads to a positive modification effect for stimulating the conversion of cloud water into rain drops.\\n* At the introduction of very high concentration of the powder no \"overseeding\" is observed, i.e., increase of drop concentration along with reduction of their size is not observed.\\n\\nThe results of numerical simulations of cloud medium formation at the initial stage of condensation have shown that:',\n",
       " '* The introduction of the salt powder into the convective subcloud layer leads to the appearance of a large-drop \"tail\" in the cloud drop size distribution. The shape of the spectrum in the large-drop region is determined by the salt powder particles spectrum.\\n* The shape of the spectrum of drops formed on background condensation nuclei does not change at rather high concentrations of the powder introduced. This means that the introduction of the salt powder does not change much the conditions of the formation of cloud drops on the background aerosol particles, except for at very high mass concentration. This result is confirmed by the experimental data obtained in the cloud chamber.\\n* As the analysis of numerical simulation results shows, the transformation of cloud drop spectra induced by the introduction of the salt powder results in much more intense coagulation processes in clouds as compared to the case of cloud modification with particles from hygroscopic flare at the same mass concentration.\\n* The salt powder results also in much more intense coagulation also with respect to hygroscopic particles having\\n\\nFigure 10: Simulated total amount of precipitations, defined as \\\\(r\\\\) \\\\(>\\\\) 200 μm, from clouds of different thicknesses without the introduction of particles (1), with the 12 kg/km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\) particles of the South African flares consumed (2), with 2.4, 6, 12, 24, 48 kg/km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\) of the salt powder (curves 3–7, respectively).

The precipitation is calculated at the level of cloud base.\\n\\n1-\\\\(\\\\upmu\\\\)m very narrow particle size distribution of the same mass concentration.',\n",
       " 'The calculated rainfall amounts of the numerical simulations with a 1-dimensional numerical model of a warm convective cloud have shown that:\\n\\n* The effect of the salt powder on clouds (total amounts of additional rain) is significantly higher than that caused by the use of hygroscopic flares at comparable consumptions of seeding agents (of the order of 10 kg/km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\)).\\n* maximum precipitation amounts\\n- is realized. A further increase of the amounts of the salt powder introduced into a cloud does not result in significant additional precipitation amounts. Owing to a fairly simplified description of cloud development in the present 1-dimentional model, the consumptions of the salt powders indicated above should be regarded as estimates. For more accurate calculations it is necessary to use more realistic 2 or 3-dimensional cloud model with full ice microphysics and dynamic feedbacks to the precipitation forming processes.\\n\\nIn summary, the experimental data and the results of numerical simulations presented here and elsewhere show that a salt powder milled to size of several \\\\(\\\\upmu\\\\)m is more effective in initiating warm rain than hygroscopic flares. The calculated amounts of seeding material reach an order of 10 kg salt per km\\\\({}^{2}\\\\) of seeded cloud. The needed mass is even larger for a smaller effect when using hygroscopic flares. This requires seeding amounts of hundreds of kg per a seeding flight. Dispersion of such quantities is not feasible with hygroscopic flares, but has been demonstrated practical with salt powder (Rosenfeld et al., 2010).',\n",
       " 'It should be cautioned that faster initiation of warm rain always leads to more rainfall on the ground (e.g., Rosenfeld et al., 2008). Net additional rainfall can be expected as long as cloud tops do not reach the minimum depth for onset of precipitation. In any case, the added rainfall amounts should be investigated in the framework of randomized cloud seeding experiments coupled with detailed model simulations.\\n\\nEdited by: D. J.

These proposed methods, referred to as geogeniereing, cover a wide range of technologies aiming to reduce either 1) the atmospheric CO\\({}_{2}\\) concentration, e.g. by air capture methods (Bacciochi et al., 2006; Mahmoudkhani and Keith, 2009) or by enhancing the oceanic carbon storage (Khesghi, 1995), or 2) the amount of solar radiation absorbed in the atmosphere and the Earth's surface, e.g. by adding sulphate aerosol to stratosphere (Crutzen, 2006) or by increasing the albedo of the land surface (Akbari et al., 2009; Rigdwell et al., 2009).\n",
